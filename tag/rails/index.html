<p>All by myself, mostly. I had a little help from friends and online resources but which programmer doesn't seek help when needed? I'm new to this world, but I bet the people that don't ask for help are either extremely smart, or pretty bad.</p>

<p>Ok, back to the app.</p>

<h2 id="theidea">The Idea</h2>

<p>It's Sunday, February 15, 2015. I'm at a wedding reception for a friend of my girlfriend. Her brother is talking about how old he thinks the groom is and how old his sister is, and each number he throws out is wrong. This is when I declare "I'll build you an app so that you'll never forget how old someone is ever again!"</p>

<p>Well, I did.</p>

<h2 id="thename">The Name</h2>

<p>It's called Birthdays ðŸŽ‰ and you can find it <a href="http://birthdays.seanosaur.com">here</a>. View the source code on <a href="http://github.com/seanosaur/birthdays">GitHub</a></p>

<h2 id="howitworks">How It Works</h2>

<p>It's pretty simple, really. You register/login then start adding birthdays of people you know. Once youâ€™ve added them all, the index shows their current age. Thatâ€™s it! Like I said, simple.</p>

<p>Now itâ€™s time for the really fun stuff. What I used!</p>

<h2 id="techspecs">Tech Specs</h2>

<li><a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-rails">foundation-rails</a> for the basic CSS framework. Iâ€™m familiar with Bootstrap and wanted to give an alternative a chance. Impressed for sure.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a> for user authentication. This one could become a mainstay quite fast.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="theextras"><em>The Extras</em></h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codeseven.github.io/toastr/demo.html">Toastr</a> for the flash messages. Fairly easy to set up. Just drop a couple files in the assets folder, create a quick helper, and youâ€™re set!</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it! It was a pretty easy setup. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to convert a birth date to age in years. Here's how I did it based on a solution found on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/819263/get-persons-age-in-ruby">StackOverflow</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">(Date.today.to_s(:number).to_i - birthday.date.to_date.to_s(:number).to_i)/1e4.to_i
</code></pre>

<p>Minus a bit of stupidity on my part with Devise, it was smooth sailing the rest of the way.</p>

      <p>The app is complete! I think.</p>

<p>Everything we needed in order to get the ball rolling is in place. I had to contract out the last 5% that I was stuck on, but soon we'll be accepting customers at <a href="http://www.formstoyourdoor.com">Forms to Your Door</a>. We have a few UI tweaks left to make and some rewording of the copy is necessary, but this thing is ready to go! I'm excited. We put a lot of time (and some money) into this idea and I have learned a significant amount about Ruby, Rails, and what it takes to build a web app. I have a lot to learn still, I know.</p>

<p>At this moment, I have taken a step back and am learning Ruby from the ground up with <em><a href="http://www.manning.com/black3/">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a></em>. Next up I'll be working through the book Justin Weiss is writing, <em><a href="https://www.justinweiss.com/book/">Practicing Rails</a></em>.</p>

      <p>As you know, I've been working with Rails for a month or 2 now. It's been taxing but Google, RailsCasts, StackOverflow, and many other resources have guided me along without just throwing the answer my way. I like to learn by doing, not just copy/pasting. Even with all this support, I still have a few things that need working out before the app is complete. I'd like to focus on one of those today.</p>

<p>I intend to use <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for payments. We have 3 payment options but for some reason Stripe keeps charging the same amount, no matter which button is clicked. Let me show you the code. Below you'll see the create module of my ChargesController.</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">def create  
  # Amount in cents
  @amount = 999
  @dollar_amount = (@amount / 100.0)

  customer = Stripe::Customer.create(
    :email     =&gt; current_user.email,
    :card     =&gt; params[:stripeToken]
  )

  charge = Stripe::Charge.create(
    :customer         =&gt; customer.id,
    :amount             =&gt; @amount,
    :description     =&gt; 'Rails Stripe customer',
    :currency            =&gt; 'usd'
  )

rescue Stripe::CardError =&gt; e  
  flash[:error] = e.message
  redirect_to charges_path
end  
</code></pre>

<p>Next up, let's take a look at the 3 different payment buttons in the view.</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-html">&lt;script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"  
    data-key="&lt;%=Rails.configuration.stripe[:publishable_key] %&gt;"
    data-name="Forms to Your Door"
    data-description="Budget-Friendly - $9.99"
    data-amount="999"
    data-panel-label="Pay {{amount}}"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-html">&lt;script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"  
    data-key="&lt;%= Rails.configuration.stripe[:publishable_key] %&gt;"
    data-name="Forms to Your Door"
    data-description="Test Taker - $14.99"
    data-amount="1499"
    data-panel-label="Pay {{amount}}"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-hmtl">&lt;script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"  
    data-key="&lt;%= Rails.configuration.stripe[:publishable_key] %&gt;"
    data-name="Forms to Your Door"
    data-description="Dean's List - $19.99"
    data-amount="1999"
    data-panel-label="Pay {{amount}}"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I have 3 nearly identical payment buttons, but am trying to charge a different amount for each. The problem I'm having is that every time the button is clicked, the controller takes over and uses the <code>@amount = 999</code> variable from the create module. How can I make this work for all 3 items?</p>

<h3 id="update">UPDATE</h3>

<h5 id="120214">(12/02/14)</h5>

<p>This issue has gone unresolved at this point, and we have narrowed the payment options to one. This will allow us to get the user signup process started and receive feedback from our customers regarding price points.</p>

      <p>I have yet to talk about this here, seeing as it wasn't quite relevant yet, but my brother and I are starting a business.  Our business is near fully formed; we have an idea, a business model/plan, a name, a domain, and even a layout built with Bootstrap.  The only piece left is the back end.</p>

<p>At first we thought it would be best (and easiest) to use a pre-made system such as WordPress.  We soon learned just how unreliable and expensive some of the necessary plugins were on WordPress and I started looking for ways to build our own system.</p>

<p>First up was PHP.  After looking into the past, present, and future of PHP I came to the conclusion that it was clunky and inefficient.  Then there were briefs affairs with Django and Flask and a very quick glance at ASP.NET.  I ended up settling on Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>As you can see from the previous posts, I have been learning bits of Ruby here and there.  It was for a reason, too.  I have heard that a number of people jump straight into Rails without any prior knowledge of the underlying language.  I imagine most have relatively good success doing that but I feel that if I am going to learn something, I am going to learn every bit of it.  So, I got started with Ruby.  The syntax was easy enough, and itâ€™s actually fun to be able to write out lines of code that most anyone could read and comprehend.  Once I had a decent grasp on Ruby (there are a lot of things I <em>donâ€™t</em> post here) it was time to move to Rails.</p>

<p>Now, Iâ€™ll be the first to admit that I had been rushing through the learning process in hopes of getting a functional site up and running as quick as possible.  Little did I know, Rails has a decent learning curve.  I canâ€™t even imagine what some of the other frameworks are like to learn.  I started slow, very slow.  First up was <a href="http://railsforzombies.org">Rails for Zombies</a>.  I watched the first video and had no clue what was happening.  When it came time to do the exercises, I was lost.  Needless to say, I struggled through that course.  After the Zombie Disaster of 2014, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org">Michael Hartlâ€™s Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a>.  It was getting easier, but I wasnâ€™t anywhere near being prepared to build a site from scratch.  After a few weeks of just creating, screwing up, deleting rails apps, I felt like it was time to learn something functional.</p>

<p>Our site (and entire business model) relies on user authentication.  We need people to sign up for our product, and we need to keep visitors out of the premium areas.  My first task was to find a walkthrough for authentication.  Luckily, I found <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/283-authentication-with-sorcery">this RailsCast</a> early on.  This is when it started to click.  I was finally learning what would eventually be necessary, and it felt great.</p>

<p>In the past few days, I have gotten a full user authentication working and am now working to incorporate <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> into our app.  If youâ€™re reading this and wondering if Rails (or anything difficult, for that matter) will ever make sense, it will.  Stick with it and youâ€™ll be thankful that you did.  My next task is incorporating our Bootstrap theme into the Rails app, and itâ€™s giving me hell!</p>
