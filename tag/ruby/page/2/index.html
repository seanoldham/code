      <p>As you know, I've been working with Rails for a month or 2 now. It's been taxing but Google, RailsCasts, StackOverflow, and many other resources have guided me along without just throwing the answer my way. I like to learn by doing, not just copy/pasting. Even with all this support, I still have a few things that need working out before the app is complete. I'd like to focus on one of those today.</p>

<p>I intend to use <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for payments. We have 3 payment options but for some reason Stripe keeps charging the same amount, no matter which button is clicked. Let me show you the code. Below you'll see the create module of my ChargesController.</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">def create  
  # Amount in cents
  @amount = 999
  @dollar_amount = (@amount / 100.0)

  customer = Stripe::Customer.create(
    :email     =&gt; current_user.email,
    :card     =&gt; params[:stripeToken]
  )

  charge = Stripe::Charge.create(
    :customer         =&gt; customer.id,
    :amount             =&gt; @amount,
    :description     =&gt; 'Rails Stripe customer',
    :currency            =&gt; 'usd'
  )

rescue Stripe::CardError =&gt; e  
  flash[:error] = e.message
  redirect_to charges_path
end  
</code></pre>

<p>Next up, let's take a look at the 3 different payment buttons in the view.</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-html">&lt;script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"  
    data-key="&lt;%=Rails.configuration.stripe[:publishable_key] %&gt;"
    data-name="Forms to Your Door"
    data-description="Budget-Friendly - $9.99"
    data-amount="999"
    data-panel-label="Pay {{amount}}"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-html">&lt;script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"  
    data-key="&lt;%= Rails.configuration.stripe[:publishable_key] %&gt;"
    data-name="Forms to Your Door"
    data-description="Test Taker - $14.99"
    data-amount="1499"
    data-panel-label="Pay {{amount}}"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-hmtl">&lt;script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"  
    data-key="&lt;%= Rails.configuration.stripe[:publishable_key] %&gt;"
    data-name="Forms to Your Door"
    data-description="Dean's List - $19.99"
    data-amount="1999"
    data-panel-label="Pay {{amount}}"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I have 3 nearly identical payment buttons, but am trying to charge a different amount for each. The problem I'm having is that every time the button is clicked, the controller takes over and uses the <code>@amount = 999</code> variable from the create module. How can I make this work for all 3 items?</p>

<h3 id="update">UPDATE</h3>

<h5 id="120214">(12/02/14)</h5>

<p>This issue has gone unresolved at this point, and we have narrowed the payment options to one. This will allow us to get the user signup process started and receive feedback from our customers regarding price points.</p>

      <p>I have yet to talk about this here, seeing as it wasn't quite relevant yet, but my brother and I are starting a business.  Our business is near fully formed; we have an idea, a business model/plan, a name, a domain, and even a layout built with Bootstrap.  The only piece left is the back end.</p>

<p>At first we thought it would be best (and easiest) to use a pre-made system such as WordPress.  We soon learned just how unreliable and expensive some of the necessary plugins were on WordPress and I started looking for ways to build our own system.</p>

<p>First up was PHP.  After looking into the past, present, and future of PHP I came to the conclusion that it was clunky and inefficient.  Then there were briefs affairs with Django and Flask and a very quick glance at ASP.NET.  I ended up settling on Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>As you can see from the previous posts, I have been learning bits of Ruby here and there.  It was for a reason, too.  I have heard that a number of people jump straight into Rails without any prior knowledge of the underlying language.  I imagine most have relatively good success doing that but I feel that if I am going to learn something, I am going to learn every bit of it.  So, I got started with Ruby.  The syntax was easy enough, and it’s actually fun to be able to write out lines of code that most anyone could read and comprehend.  Once I had a decent grasp on Ruby (there are a lot of things I <em>don’t</em> post here) it was time to move to Rails.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll be the first to admit that I had been rushing through the learning process in hopes of getting a functional site up and running as quick as possible.  Little did I know, Rails has a decent learning curve.  I can’t even imagine what some of the other frameworks are like to learn.  I started slow, very slow.  First up was <a href="http://railsforzombies.org">Rails for Zombies</a>.  I watched the first video and had no clue what was happening.  When it came time to do the exercises, I was lost.  Needless to say, I struggled through that course.  After the Zombie Disaster of 2014, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org">Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a>.  It was getting easier, but I wasn’t anywhere near being prepared to build a site from scratch.  After a few weeks of just creating, screwing up, deleting rails apps, I felt like it was time to learn something functional.</p>

<p>Our site (and entire business model) relies on user authentication.  We need people to sign up for our product, and we need to keep visitors out of the premium areas.  My first task was to find a walkthrough for authentication.  Luckily, I found <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/283-authentication-with-sorcery">this RailsCast</a> early on.  This is when it started to click.  I was finally learning what would eventually be necessary, and it felt great.</p>

<p>In the past few days, I have gotten a full user authentication working and am now working to incorporate <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> into our app.  If you’re reading this and wondering if Rails (or anything difficult, for that matter) will ever make sense, it will.  Stick with it and you’ll be thankful that you did.  My next task is incorporating our Bootstrap theme into the Rails app, and it’s giving me hell!</p>

      <p>In my previous post, I was trying to output a sentence that had user input - or <code>gets</code> - in the middle. Here's what I had:</p>

<pre><code class="language- prettyprint language-ruby">puts "What do you want?!"  
puts "what do you mean '" + gets + "'?! you're fired!".upcase  
</code></pre>

<p>There was a problem with the output in that it kept breaking the sentence and starting the second half on the next line. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what was causing this. Then, I remembered <code>.chomp</code></p>

<pre><code class="language- prettyprint language-ruby">puts "What do you want?!"  
puts ("what do you mean '" + gets.chomp + "'?! you're fired!").upcase  
</code></pre>

<p><code>.chomp</code> solves this problem by 'chomping' the Enter/Return keystroke that the user inputs. Unlike Python, or other languages I've worked with to this point, Ruby takes <em>everything</em> the user inputs and saves it. When someone types a response to the initial question, they have to hit Enter to go to the next step of the program. This Enter gets saved and used in the output. The parentheses are necessary to make sure that <code>.upcase</code> isn't only working on the 2nd half of the sentence.</p>
