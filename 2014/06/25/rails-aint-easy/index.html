      <p>I have yet to talk about this here, seeing as it wasn't quite relevant yet, but my brother and I are starting a business.  Our business is near fully formed; we have an idea, a business model/plan, a name, a domain, and even a layout built with Bootstrap.  The only piece left is the back end.</p>

<p>At first we thought it would be best (and easiest) to use a pre-made system such as WordPress.  We soon learned just how unreliable and expensive some of the necessary plugins were on WordPress and I started looking for ways to build our own system.</p>

<p>First up was PHP.  After looking into the past, present, and future of PHP I came to the conclusion that it was clunky and inefficient.  Then there were briefs affairs with Django and Flask and a very quick glance at ASP.NET.  I ended up settling on Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>As you can see from the previous posts, I have been learning bits of Ruby here and there.  It was for a reason, too.  I have heard that a number of people jump straight into Rails without any prior knowledge of the underlying language.  I imagine most have relatively good success doing that but I feel that if I am going to learn something, I am going to learn every bit of it.  So, I got started with Ruby.  The syntax was easy enough, and it’s actually fun to be able to write out lines of code that most anyone could read and comprehend.  Once I had a decent grasp on Ruby (there are a lot of things I <em>don’t</em> post here) it was time to move to Rails.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll be the first to admit that I had been rushing through the learning process in hopes of getting a functional site up and running as quick as possible.  Little did I know, Rails has a decent learning curve.  I can’t even imagine what some of the other frameworks are like to learn.  I started slow, very slow.  First up was <a href="http://railsforzombies.org">Rails for Zombies</a>.  I watched the first video and had no clue what was happening.  When it came time to do the exercises, I was lost.  Needless to say, I struggled through that course.  After the Zombie Disaster of 2014, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org">Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a>.  It was getting easier, but I wasn’t anywhere near being prepared to build a site from scratch.  After a few weeks of just creating, screwing up, deleting rails apps, I felt like it was time to learn something functional.</p>

<p>Our site (and entire business model) relies on user authentication.  We need people to sign up for our product, and we need to keep visitors out of the premium areas.  My first task was to find a walkthrough for authentication.  Luckily, I found <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/283-authentication-with-sorcery">this RailsCast</a> early on.  This is when it started to click.  I was finally learning what would eventually be necessary, and it felt great.</p>

<p>In the past few days, I have gotten a full user authentication working and am now working to incorporate <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> into our app.  If you’re reading this and wondering if Rails (or anything difficult, for that matter) will ever make sense, it will.  Stick with it and you’ll be thankful that you did.  My next task is incorporating our Bootstrap theme into the Rails app, and it’s giving me hell!</p>
