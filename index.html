      <p>I have a project that requires me to revise a record and keep track of that revision. Without even thinking, I was going to set the initial revision level to <code>0</code> then increment by one each time the record was updated. Well, that won't work because these revision levels need to be tracked with alpha characters (A=1, B=2, ...).</p>

<p>My next idea was to create a helper that would translate numbers to letters. I was sure there was something out there that could do that, maybe even within Ruby. So I started searching. That's when I came across <code>.succ</code>. What a great little tool! <code>.succ</code> will take your string (or integer) and give you the "next in line" value. For instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">&gt; "1".succ
=&gt; "2"
&gt; 1.succ
=&gt; 2
&gt; "a".succ
=&gt; "b"
&gt; "Z".succ
=&gt; "AA"
&gt; "ruby".succ
=&gt; "rubz"
&gt; "rubz".succ
=&gt; "ruca"
</code></pre>

<p>Watch out for floats, they don't play nice.</p>

<p>This method is <em>exactly</em> what I needed for my revision tracking and now you know about it. Now get out there and use it!</p>

Limiting ourselves to one language or framework isn't what development is about. We need to broaden our horizons and seek out new knowledge of the unknown. That last part might have sounded a little too "Carl Sagan" but it's true. If we get people in there that only want to learn Rails, how will they know when another framework or process is easier and more applicable?</p>

      <p>Yesterday I came across <a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby">TestFirst.org</a> and became determined to learn about RSpec and how to test properly. Along my journey through their exercises, there was one that required the calculation of a factorial. I can do those all day with a pen and paper, but it's a different task to write a method that takes any number as an argument and does the math for me. For those that don't know, a factorial looks like this <code>5!</code> and can be calculated like this <code>5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1</code>.</p>

<p>This is where <code>.downto</code> comes into play. Instead of having to figure out what number the method took and then multiplying down, you can just do something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">def factorial(num)  
  if num &gt; 0
    num.downto(1).inject(:*)
  else
    1
  end
end  
</code></pre>

<p>The part you have to watch out for is if <code>num</code> is ever 0. The factorial of 0 is 1 and so it can be tricky to write that out in code. Don't ask me why 0! = 1 and if you don't believe me, <a href="http://www.zero-factorial.com/whatis.html">read about it here</a>.</p>

<p><code>.downto</code> can also be used for countdowns!</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">10.downto(1) { |n| print "#{n}..." }  
</code></pre>

<p>will return  </p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...  
</code></pre>

<p>Who knew <code>.downto</code> was so useful and could also be fun? Time to write a <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal Space Program</a> script for my launches!</p>

<p>All by myself, mostly. I had a little help from friends and online resources but which programmer doesn't seek help when needed? I'm new to this world, but I bet the people that don't ask for help are either extremely smart, or pretty bad.</p>

<p>Ok, back to the app.</p>

<h2 id="theidea">The Idea</h2>

<p>It's Sunday, February 15, 2015. I'm at a wedding reception for a friend of my girlfriend. Her brother is talking about how old he thinks the groom is and how old his sister is, and each number he throws out is wrong. This is when I declare "I'll build you an app so that you'll never forget how old someone is ever again!"</p>

<p>Well, I did.</p>

<h2 id="thename">The Name</h2>

<p>It's called Birthdays 🎉 and you can find it <a href="http://birthdays.seanosaur.com">here</a>. View the source code on <a href="http://github.com/seanosaur/birthdays">GitHub</a></p>

<h2 id="howitworks">How It Works</h2>

<p>It's pretty simple, really. You register/login then start adding birthdays of people you know. Once you’ve added them all, the index shows their current age. That’s it! Like I said, simple.</p>

<p>Now it’s time for the really fun stuff. What I used!</p>

<h2 id="techspecs">Tech Specs</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-rails">foundation-rails</a> for the basic CSS framework. I’m familiar with Bootstrap and wanted to give an alternative a chance. Impressed for sure.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a> for user authentication. This one could become a mainstay quite fast.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="theextras"><em>The Extras</em></h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codeseven.github.io/toastr/demo.html">Toastr</a> for the flash messages. Fairly easy to set up. Just drop a couple files in the assets folder, create a quick helper, and you’re set!</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it! It was a pretty easy setup. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to convert a birth date to age in years. Here's how I did it based on a solution found on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/819263/get-persons-age-in-ruby">StackOverflow</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">(Date.today.to_s(:number).to_i - birthday.date.to_date.to_s(:number).to_i)/1e4.to_i
</code></pre>

<p>Minus a bit of stupidity on my part with Devise, it was smooth sailing the rest of the way.</p>

      <p>Today, I wrote my first Ruby script.</p>

<p>I'll lead off by saying it's not technically my first script, but it's the first one I've pieced together without a walkthrough, tutorial, or book.</p>

<p>I'm in a Rails study group on Slack (if you want in, leave me a comment below) and we're preparing to build our first app. In preparation, I was looking for a Reddit gem or API translation for Ruby. That's when I found <a href="http://redditkit.com">RedditKit</a>. It looked fantastic and I had to try it out for myself. I followed a few of the examples to get a feel for it and then went off on my own.</p>

<p>I wanted a user to type in their <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> and it would spit out a list of the subreddits they subscribe to and the number of followers for each. Setting up the login was simple, but I had my information hardcoded in so that had to change if I planned to share this with my study group.</p>

<p>Next up was the subreddits. I was able to iterate through the list of subreddits, but I still couldn't figure out how to sort them. I was getting frustrated. Ruby was breaking my spirit right before my eyes. I created a blank hash, <code>sub</code>, then chose the subreddit's url as the key and the number of subscribers as the value. Then, I sorted the value and printed. Done!</p>

<p>This whole process took something close to two hours. It's far from perfect and could probably use a visit from <a href="http://batsov.com/rubocop/">RuboCop</a>, but it's the first script I've written by myself and I'm proud of it.</p>

<p>View the script below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-prettyprint language-ruby">require 'redditkit'

def reddit(u, p)  
  user = RedditKit::Client.new u, p
  subreddits = user.subscribed_subreddits
  sub = {}
  subreddits.each do |s|
    sub[:"#{s.url}"] = s.subscribers
  end
  puts sub.sort_by { |k,v| k }
end

puts 'Username: '  
u = gets.chomp  
puts 'Password: '  
p = gets.chomp  
reddit(u,p)
